## What is this?
This is a basic graphing tool made with p5.js that can graph basic numbers.

**Note:**
* This graphing tool doesn't have a visble numberline.
* Doesn't work with funcions that have undefined values e.i (1/x).
* May have problems rendering extremely detailed functions.

### Example 1:


>$$f(x)=x^2$$
